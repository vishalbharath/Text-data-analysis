# Text Data Analysis for Offensive Language Using ML

This repository contains the code and resources for analyzing text data to detect offensive language using various machine learning (ML) techniques. The goal of this project is to build a robust model that can identify and classify offensive content in text data, which can be used for content moderation, social media analysis, and more.

## Introduction

Offensive language detection is a critical task in natural language processing (NLP) that helps in maintaining healthy online communities. This project focuses on analyzing text data using machine learning algorithms to classify offensive content.

## Features

- **Preprocessing**: Cleaning and preparing text data for analysis.
- **Feature Extraction**: Techniques such as TF-IDF, word embeddings, etc.
- **Modeling**: Training various machine learning models like Logistic Regression, SVM, Random Forest, and Neural Networks.
- **Evaluation**: Assessing model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
- **Visualization**: Visualizing data distribution, model performance, and results.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/vishalbharath/Text-data-analysis.git
    ```

2. **Set up a virtual environment** (optional but recommended):
    ```bash
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

3. **Install the required packages**:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

1. **Prepare the dataset**: Place your text data file (e.g., `data.csv`) in the `data/` directory.

2. **Run the preprocessing script**:
    ```bash
    python src/preprocess.py --input data/data.csv --output data/cleaned_data.csv
    ```

3. **Train the model**:
    ```bash
    python src/train_model.py --data data/cleaned_data.csv
    ```

4. **Evaluate the model**:
    ```bash
    python src/evaluate.py --model models/best_model.pkl --test data/test_data.csv
    ```

5. **Generate visualizations** (optional):
    ```bash
    python src/visualize.py --results results/metrics.json
    ```

## Data

The dataset used in this project should be in CSV format with at least two columns: `text` and `label`. The `text` column contains the text data to be analyzed, and the `label` column contains the corresponding class labels (e.g., `offensive`, `non-offensive`).

## Model Training

The models are trained using the cleaned and preprocessed data. Different machine learning algorithms are implemented and compared to find the best-performing model for offensive language detection.

## Evaluation

Model performance is evaluated using standard metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Cross-validation is also performed to ensure model robustness.

## Results

The results of the analysis, including model performance metrics and visualizations, are saved in the `results/` directory.
